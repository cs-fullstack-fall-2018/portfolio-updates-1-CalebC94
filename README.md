# portfolio-updates-1

1) Where are you now?
I'm still in the beginning of editing my portfolio to make look presentable.  

2) What are you going to finish today?
Attempt to add my resume & my information in the "About" section, as well as add the "tic-tac-toe" & "guessing" games we made.

3) What will you finish by the end of the week?
I'm planning on finishing all or most of my tabs so that they have the appropriate links, complete most of the needed aesthetics,
